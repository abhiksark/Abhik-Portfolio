### Paper Overview

The paper presents a case study on optimizing transformers by focusing on data movement. It shows that data movement is the bottleneck in transformer models and proposes a new approach to optimize data movement.

### Key Contributions

1. **Data Movement is the Bottleneck**
   - Shows that data movement is the bottleneck in transformer models
   - Proposes a new approach to optimize data movement

2. **Data Movement Optimizations**
   - Uses a new approach to optimize data movement
   - Shows that the new approach is faster than the original approach


3. **Conclusion**
   - Shows that the new approach is faster than the original approach
   - Proposes a new approach to optimize data movement
